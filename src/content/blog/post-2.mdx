## Showing a title and icon in a SwiftUI Toolbar

In SwiftUI, we are able to place items in a toolbar using the `.toolbar` modifier
and then creating a `ToolbarItem` in the closure of that modifier.

However, some components display differently when placed in a toolbar rather than a
standard View. In this case, we are taking a look at the **Label** view, which only
shows its icon / image when placed in a toolbar.

To show the title and icon, we need to modify the **Label** view with the following:

```swift
// Sample label with title and SFSymbol icon
Label("Title", systemImage: "plus")
    .labelStyle(.titleAndIcon)
```

By applying the `.labelStyle` modifier with `.titleAndIcon`, the **Label** will now show
both its title and icon.

To use other styles, check out the [Apple Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/labelstyle).
