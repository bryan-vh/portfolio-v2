## Hello!

I'm Bryan and I'm a software developer with passion for iOS development, fun side projects and
building with new technologies.

Most of the topics that I'll cover with these blog posts will usually fall into one of
these main categories:

* **SwiftUI**
* **Swift**
* **iOS Development**
* **Startups**
* **and more**

I'll also try to share updates about various side projects that I'll be working on in my
spare time. These will usually be iOS apps and some websites, but I'm always looking to 
try out new frameworks and technologies so be prepared for some surprises.

I plan to write a new post about every other week, but it might fluctuate based on what's
going on in my life.
