## NavigationStack

Starting with **iOS 16**, Apple introduced its new navigation API for SwiftUI
which revolves around the new View called the **NavigationStack**.

The key difference between NavigationStack and NavigationView is that it allows
you to pass an array of items that conform to the `Hashable` protocol, which
can represent the different routes in your app.

To initialize a NavigationStack in your app with a set of routes, do the following:

```swift
enum Route: Hashable {
    case route1
    case route2
    // ...
}

struct NavView: View {

    @State private var paths = [Route]()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(paths: $paths) {
            // Put your starting view here
            RootView()
                .navigationDestination(for: Route.self) { route in
                    switch (route) {
                    case .route1: Route1View()
                    case .route2: Route2View()    
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
```

Using NavigationStack, we can determine exactly which **View** will show
for each route.

## Associated Value Routes

Using Swift Enum's associated value property, you can then pass certain 
parameters to each route, like so:

```swift
enum ValuedRoute: Hashable {
    case route1(String)
    case route2(Int, Int)
    // ...
}
```

You can then pass these values down to a specific view depending on its initializer.
So you can have a **Route1View** that is initialized with that parameter as needed.

## Standalone Router

To push and pop routes off the stack programmatically, it can be useful to use a standalone
router that can be passed down via the environment. This **Router** will be responsible
for storing the state of the routes for a **NavigationStack**.

```swift
class Router<Route: Hashable>: ObservableObject {
    @Published var paths: [Route] = []

    func push(_ route: Route) {
        paths.append(route)
    }

    func pop() {
        paths.removeLast()
    }
}
```

To use this with your NavigationStack you could then set up the following:

```swift
struct NavView: View {

    @StateObject private var router = Router<Route>()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(paths: $router.paths) {
            // Put your starting view here
            RootView()
                .navigationDestination(for: Route.self) { route in
                    switch (route) {
                    case .route1: Route1View()
                    case .route2: Route2View()    
                    }
                }
        }
        .environmentObject(router)
    }
}
```

You can then access the router in any of the Views on the stack using
the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper.

## Voyager

If you want a completely reusable solution for this that also works
seamlessly with tab-based navigation, consider checking out [Voyager](https://www.github.com/bryan-vh/Voyager.git),
a lightweight type-safe Swift Package I built to handle all of these
issues out of the box.
