## What is an Actor?

Starting with Swift 5.5, an actor is a new way to declare a type, just like you would with
`class`, `enum` or `struct`. Unlike these other classes, however, the `actor` type declaration
provides thread-safe access to mutable properties and functions with Swift's concurrency
system via `async / await`.

## Actors vs Classes

Actors are very similar to classes (they are passed by reference) but come with one key difference
that allow them to ideally operate in a concurrent environment.

- Actors (**automatically!**) allow only one caller to access their mutable properties and methods at any
  given time.

For example, let's say we want some data store that will hold all of our posts for our blogging app. Rather
than create a `class`, we can create an `actor` that will allow for multithreaded access to our posts data.

```swift
actor PostsDataStore {
    var posts = Set<Post>()

    func add(_ post: Post) {
        posts.insert(post)
    }

    func remove(_ post: Post) {
        posts.remove(post)
    }
}
```

By using the `actor` type declaration, all of **PostsDataStore**'s methods & properties are now implicitly thread-safe. Now
let's look at how we can interact with these methods & properties using async / await.

## Using Actor methods and properties with async / await

In order to call **PostsDataStore**'s `fetchAll` method, the **PostsViewModel** has to use the `await` keyword in an asynchronous
context. Under the hood, this ensures that the operations of adding and fetching are serialized correctly between threads.

```swift
class PostsViewModel {
    private let store = PostsDataStore()

    func add() async {
        let post = Post(title: "New post", date: .now)
        await store.add(post)
    }

    func fetchAll() async -> [Post] {
        let posts = await store.posts
        return Array(posts)
    }
}
```

In this case, let's assume that the user attempts to add a post on one thread while fetching posts on another thread. By using
an actor, we prevent nasty data races and keep our posts data clean. It also saves time debugging in Xcode, which usually isn't fun.

## That's the Tea

Hopefully you can see how actors are extremely valuable for adapting your code to Swift's new concurrency paradigm. Not only
do they provide a simple type declaration to make thread-safe properties and methods, actors also allow for easy interfacing
via `async / await`. Be sure to try them out in your next project!
